# qmk-staging
A 'staging' for some of my experimental QMK stuff

## Firmware size limitations

* 'ProMicro': Around 32K as a firmware limit (minus a bit for the bootloader), making 28k the general limit
* 'STM32F411': Around 512K as a firmware limit (minus some for the bootloader). This is the StemCell v1
* 'STM32F411CEUS6': Around 8000 (!) kb flash (blackpill)
* 'RP2040': Around 16000 (!) kb flash (Rpi)
