This appears to be unmaintained, but at the time was the best way to actually draw out the layout for the keyboard.
In recent times, I found it hard to use because it really only focuses on layers. They're a fun abstraction but it's not really useful.

Also when you have tiny keyboards, you end up having way more combos, so you need something that can visualize that better... my combo visualization was a bit clumsy here
